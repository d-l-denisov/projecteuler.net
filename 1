#
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

for i in range(999,100,-1):
    for j in range(999,100,-1):
        p = i * j

            print (i, j, p)
