# Task (https://projecteuler.net/problem=4):
#
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# 
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

        p = i * j

                if p > m:
                    m = p
